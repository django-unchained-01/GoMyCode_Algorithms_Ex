## String_methods Algorithm

This project contains a simple algorithm written in pseudocode that analyzes a string to:

- Count the number of words (by counting spaces)
- Count the number of vowels (`a`, `e`, `y`, `o`, `u`, `i`)
- Output the length of the string

### How it works

1. The algorithm reads a string input.
2. It iterates through each character in the string:
   - If the character is a vowel, it increments the vowel count.
   - If the character is a space, it increments the word count.
3. At the end, it prints:
   - The number of words
   - The number of vowels
   - The length of the string

### Example

**Input:**  
`hello world`

**Output:**

```
Number of words: 2
Number of vowels: 3
Length of string: 11
```
